Using shaders and custom 3D objects... </p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>As these projects become more complex, I recognized that imposing structure early would be much easier than later.
Additionally, I wanted to segregate code written by others into discrete and distinct units.</p>  
<p>Moving files is certainly simple, but adapting the Makefile required plenty of Googling.
After struggling with the Make variables and failing, I discovered <code>VPATH</code> in the Makefile documentation.
Adding this colon-delimited virtual path to my Makefile, <code>VPATH = util3d:lib</code>, 
with an entry for every library/directory has really helped keep things a bit more tidy.</p>
<h2>Wings</h2>
<p>I have modeled my house in Sketchup with a fair degree of accuracy and detail. There is a learning curve to Sketchp, 
but Wings also has a rustic feel. Using Wings3D is like learning to use vim (which I am) after having only used fancy 
word processors like MS Word.</p>

<p> Initial frustration with Wings led me to try the Blender. While Blender has a slicker
interface (like Word) and probably more features, the learning curve was so steep that after 2 evenings wasted, I threw in the towel.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Having found a few settings and gotten comfortable with it, I really enjoy using Wings for this sort of modeling.</li>
    <li>In hindsight, I probably would have saved DIY modeling for lagniappe and focused on other parts of the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2>More organizational efforts</h2>
<p>Assembling the infrastructure to handle shaders was straightforward with provided code.
I segregated <em>shader code</em> into a <code>shader.c</code> module that I called from main with a single call.</p>

<p>Much more could and should be done do further generalize these functions, but it is a beginning...</p>
